Biz_App is mock software that emulates simplistic cashier software. Biz_App was primarily created to gain experience with using GUIs in Python, as there is no pratical use for this project. Running BIZ_APP.py will display a GUI where you can simulate orders, and other functions you would expect to see in cashier software. When exporting orders, a report named Sales_Report_*MONTH*_*DAY*.xlsx is generated.
